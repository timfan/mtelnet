		There is always a question that why some people take ages to read a menu, while others can decide what to eat in seconds. Now the deliverer is there for those who are not used to speak to a delivery guy or find hard to decide what to eat — just tweet a food emoji and get real food delivered.

	According to an article in Mashable.com, here comes a new website that foodies and emoji-lover would love. Fooji, a combination of ‘food’ and ‘emoji’, calls their service “the simplification of food ordering and delivery”. You only need to log into the Fooji site with your Twitter account, enter your address for delivery and payment information. Then you could start browsing the "menu", which is the set of food emoji currently available. For example, tweet an bread emoji and you will get a sandwich. The specific ingredients of the dish can not be chosen but only the category of it—which means from now on you may be looking forwards to your lunch a little bit more. Adding a tiny surprise to the mundane routine of life —or disappointment at times, the food that comes in is unexpected.<br/><br/>

	Founded by Gregg Morton and Erik Zamudio, Fooji’s operation model is inspired from Domino’s Pizza, which customers can order pizzas via tweeting a pizza emoji. But what really sparks off the idea of being an agent between food and digital picgraph in communication is their own experience.  ‘One day we were sitting in the office trying to figure out what we should get for lunch and we ended up spending nearly an hour trying to pick a meal. We knew we wanted sandwiches, but just couldn’t decide on where to go,’ Morton said in an interview with iDigitalTimes. <br/><br/>

	"We have a name for this: we call it 'Netflix syndrome.' If you use Netflix, you know that you spend hours browsing through movies and by the time you’re done you wish you had just read a book and called it a night. Anyway, we started joking about how nice it would be if we could just send one tweet, one emoji, and get the food we wanted. After laughing it off and creating a name for this ridiculous idea (Fooji), we went home. Two days later I called Erik and the rest is history."<br/><br/>

	This is how Fooji works as the middleman. It partnered with Seamless and GrubHub to create a system for randomized ordering. When you tweet an emoji for the type of cuisine you want, the algorithm finds a restaurant in the local area with a 4- or 5-star rating and chooses the highest-rated dishes. Originally, Fooji planned to fulfill orders manually, but it gained more attention and became far more popular than expected. <br/><br/>

	As placing an order means broadcasting it on twitter, it opened up conversations. Followers could comment on your order and it did help promote Fooji’s service tweet by tweet.   <br/><br/>

	“On a weekly basis we assign food emojis to a top item to a top restaurant in the area. It will be the closest approximation, and we’ll take into account what is the most popular or featured item from the restaurant,” Gregg told ABC news. “We also have a wild card option, so if you have no idea what you want, we have a fork and knife emoji where we’ll pick the most popular item of the day and order it for you.”<br/><br/>

	As for demographic, anyone can use Fooji but "Fooji’s primary demo is millennials," Morton told iDigitalTimes. "We are launching in Lower Manhattan and will expand to the other Manhattan zip codes on a weekly basis after launch. We do have plans to hit all major markets, but no definitive rollout schedule as of yet." It serves San Francisco as well now showing on their website.<br/>
	Each meal costs $15 including tax, tip and delivery. Fooji handpick the food from a surprise local restaurant and place the order to make its way to the customers. Fooji makes about $2 off each purchase. The concept is best for those who are adventurous with their meals to explore local dining. Yet, picky eater or people with dietary restrictions had better not try out, for there is no way to request preferences, such as no pickles, even if a customer is allergic to certain foods. There is a lot of room for Fooji to decide what to deliver. Like what happens if an apple emoji is tweeted? Will an apple pie be delivered, or an apple-pork burger? It sounds not a good deal if customers find out the food only costs $11. Why don’t they just order it straight away from the restaurant? <br/>
	Fooji blurred the line between digital communication and the real world by combining social media and food delivery. According to an article by Catchyagency.com, “ Digital communications are making the seemingly unavoidable leap into the real world around us.” In this case, Fooji arouses echoes, which proved innovation is the key to success.  Althought, no one knows when the buzz around fooji would take off, as people would not order random meals all the time. Large franchise restaurants may obtain the technology sooner or later.
