Many customers have suffered from calling a company and getting stuck on hold for what seems like an eternity, a new ad tech solution helps to improve users’ experiences by communicating with customers individually in a more personalized manner. 
<br/>
<br/>Three global brand giants Unilever, Campbell Soup Company and GSK Consumer Healthcare have engaged in cognitive advertising technology Watson Ads, which launched by The Weather Company, a subsidiary of IBM. It enables marketers to response users’ enquiry and promote products via voice or text on desktop and mobile platforms. For example, if an individual ask about what he/she should make for dinner that night. Watson will then provide various choices with data-driven response.  
<br/>
<br/>“Based on its machine learning and reasoning ability from the recipe data it has ingested, Watson can sort through ingredient and flavor profiles to make recommendations based on the weather, time of day, location and even ingredients users have on hand – all surfaced via dynamic ads,” explained by Jeremy Steinberg, global head of sales at The Weather Company. 
<br/>
<br/>The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in advertising is making widespread and accelerating exponentially. It is not a science-fiction plot only appeared in Hollywood movies anymore, but a commonly used tactics to attract tech-savvy customers, as more and more people are used to artificial intelligence-enabled devices that blending into the background of their everyday life. In responding to this trend, brands need to be part of their customers’ social media conversations.
<br/>
<br/>As a potential market set to grow, innovative advertising technologies create lucrative revenue opportunities for marketers and advertisers. Real-time interactive function is particularly essential for customized suggestions to individuals based on pertinent data. Take Watson case for instance, it is able to provide current weather conditions from The Weather Company’s sources to location-targeted users, in result of strengthening brand loyalty and motivating desire to purchase.
<br/>
<br/>Jeremy believes AI-powered units shift the marketing pattern from strategy informing media to using media to inform strategy. “It's not only a cognitive experience for consumers but also for marketers, as we're continuously gathering consumer preferences and turning them into actionable insights. These cognitive ads learn preferences to personalize content and deliver them at scale,” he said.
<br/>
<br/>According to the Weather Company, in order to work more closely with marketers, they are planning to set up the Watson Ads Council, which acts as sounding board for latest innovations leveraging Watson Ads and cognitive advancements in advertising. In a foreseeable time, it is likely that the technology can also apply to other medium channels like television, connected cars and social media networks. The groundbreaking news is a good reminder for all industry professionals to stay alert and adapt to cutting-edge advertising technologies in the fast-changing market.
