		It is undeniable that visual content is revolutionizing the online world. Nowadays, infographic becomes the most popular way to tell stories and help people to digest much more information. Bing Search may also recognize the ongoing trend and has recently launched two new features on its Bing Search app － image search and a built-in QR Code scanner, which even Google Search mobile app hasn’t provided yet. 
<br/>
<br/>Although image search is already allowed on desktop and browser version, users are still unable to upload a picture on their Google mobile app. Yet, Bing Search app is one step ahead of the game by introducing this gimmick. 
<br/>
<br/>Have you experienced a situation that when you are looking for information of a product or a place, image pops up into your head but you just could not figure out any suitable words to describe it? Now there’s a solution. By simply taking a picture of an image that you want to search or import/upload something from your photo gallery, Bing search will find where that image came from or who that person in the picture is for you. For a more precise result, users can choose to crop the image as well.
<br/>
<br/>Another new twist is the QR code scanner, there is nothing special about how it works as any other scanner, but it does not required users to download another separate app because the scanner is built in the Bing Search. By scanning the barcodes, the search engine will automatically switch to website or app in seconds. In a digital world where time is money, it is definitely appealing to users for saving dwell time of waiting.
<br/>
<br/>In addition to the major changes, latest update also involves a touch query feature. When you tap the separate words, you can get new suggestions for pictures and video search. However, these unique functions are only available in the United States for now. For users in other regions, you may need to be more patient. 
<br/>
<br/>Unlike other applications that display content as many as possible, the interface of Bing image search is so clean and neat that even people who are not familiar with tech gadgets could get on hand very quickly. Focusing on only a few major features and keeping the UI design simple make the app user-friendly enough and therefore attract users from all age groups. 
<br/>
<br/>Search engine marketing has been a hot topic in technological sectors. The action of Bing Search should be a great news for all marketers, as it assists them to optimize the search engine more effectively. While the importance of words is declining, marketing industry should rethink their business strategies in digital sphere of the perceptible shifting from text to image in order to cater the needs of users in new era. In the near future, it is necessary for them to consider bringing image search into their promotional plans and achieve better accessibility for their client’s products or services.
