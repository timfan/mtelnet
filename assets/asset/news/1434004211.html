	With the notion ‘Mobile first’ in its motto, Mtel believes mobile responsive designs are the first thing to develop for brands and companies in our time. Everyone owns at least one mobile device which the portability enables one to acquire the most convenient access to the Internet. Therefore Mtel has fully applied its speciality of app writing, dedicating to sponsoring and developing an all-around official event application for both android and IOS systems. The RAE 2015 app provides related information including event schedules, the media centre, a survey page and hot products for the event. The app was easy-to-use since the directory of exhibitors and events details are just in a few clicks and clearly listed in a row. Relevant future event advertisements such as Retail Expo China are shown at the bottom. With the feature of media centre, users can review the brilliant event videos and photos by professional photographers at ease.<br/>

	Aside from the app sponsoring, Mtel’s Chief Technology Officer Jeff Chau gave a seminar covering the topic ‘How Big Data Powers Up The Customer Journey’. The seminar was inspiring and highly recommended so the theatre was full to capacity. <br/><br/>

	When talking of big data, we talk about 3V: volume, variety and velocity. Volume refers to the amount of data, variety refers to the number of types of data and velocity refers to the speed of data processing. The amount of big data is over trillions; it can be collected from various sources internally and externally. While internal data comes from customer purchases and loyalty programmes, external data sources include social media, web, mobile and news. Velocity means how fast the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and the challenges that lie in the path of growth and development. <br/><br/>

	In this fast-changing media arena, our consumption pattern now has been changing accordingly; shopping is not solely done in a physical store as online shopping was upraised years ago. However, for online shopping, you now even have more options than just sitting at home waiting for delivery. The megatrend of shopping is not just about multi-channel anymore. There comes a new combination when online meets offline, which intertwine and generate a lot more possibilities. When there are more customer touchpoints, the cross-channel interactions enable real-time reaction to customers journey. As a result, the customer journey is extended, which encourages stronger customer engagement. In return, more data can be collected, which helps optimizing the customer experience. <br/><br/>

	In response to this phenomenon, Mtel has provided series of digital solution strategies. The two clips shown at their booth at the Expo have demonstrated their expertise. An O2O retail mobile app ‘BUY', standing for Be the Unique You, illustrates how shopping experience has been reshaped when online and offline are integrated. <br/><br/>

	'BUY' allows users to personalize their purchase carts, by putting selected products all in one and check out the whole look right away. Customers can choose to pick up goods at a local store. Once the order is placed, all the products are well packed and ready for picking up. While e-commerce solution allows people to shop anytime, anywhere, they can still enjoy face-to-face customer service for fitting and advice. Meanwhile, buyers will be rewarded by getting stamped with the app at specific corners in the shop. The app thus enables Mtel to collect data of mass shopping journey, behavior and preference for future positioning.<br/><br/>

	Yet, Mtel's digital solutions are not limited to mobile app development only. Have you ever thought of inserting an interactive informative panel as a part of the window display next to your shop’s entrance? Abandoning traditional boring window display that merely presents the products, digital installation is more lively and multifunctional to embellish one's brand image. When no one is using the panel, it serves as a big screen playing fashion show highlights for promotion. But it can be turned into a mega interactive tablet in one second-- customers can explore what’s new in the store and drag their favorite items to a QR code, by which they can review their wish list back home and share to social media platforms. Digital window displays can also give a new twist in creating noise. For instance, you can peek in to watch the latest trend video, which makes those who pass by curious about what is inside. To achieve the best result, Mtel strives to transform brands’ image and increase sales by producing solutions both aesthetic and functional.<br/>
	Speaking of the innovative digital solutions, Augmented Reality(AR) solutions have been very popular and widely used in recent years, especially in museum exhibitions and events, as it adds entertaining elements and interactivity to visitors. In the expo, Mtel showcased an Augmented Reality work from their partner, INDE Appshaker, which produces broadcast Augmented Reality for National Geographic Chanel. With the principles of augmented reality, it turns impossibilities into possibilities. People can immerse themselves in different scenes such as feeling connected with the real-like polar bears and penguins from the Pole. The clip has triggered off a lot of echoes on the spot. AR solutions will be further incorporated in Mtel's projects in Hong Kong and Macau in the near future. Stay tuned for their greater works! <br/>
	After a fruitful day showcasing the latest solutions at their booth, it is Mtel’s pleasure to join the cocktail party and the gala dinner to celebrate the retail trade in Asia-Pacific in the evening. Mtel has sponsored an Apple watch for the lucky draw in the gala dinner. An exclusive dinner of delicacies and delightful entertainment was served to committee members and senior executives from the retail industry. Mtel treasured the opportunity to network and mingle with retailers from different sectors including luxury, fashion, FMCG and electronics. <br/><br/>

	Mtel's 3-day participation in the expo has successfully came to an end, with goals well accomplished as the interaction with visitors are inspiring and full of sparkles. It is a valuable and significant experience for Mtel to get connected with professionals from different domains and visitors around the world. With very positive feedbacks, Mtel will better master and refine their future directions and planning by responding to the demands in the market and understanding the status quo of the society and the industry. Through this successful participation in the expo, Mtel will partake again in the event promising to bring new developments and growth to impress the audiences next year.
