		Office of the Government Chief Information Officer has invited our CEO, Mr. Willy Wong to give the keynote address at the event "When NGO bumps into an IT person" (NGO與IT人有個約會) on 16th Oct.
		<br/>		 
		<br/>		 
		It was an event for social service organizations to meet with ICT companies to germinate ideas on how to leverage ICT in social service delivery innovatively. Inspirations on how to support social service organizations and develop more mobile apps for special needs groups were shared among the industries. We truly believe that NGOs would be benefited from the technological advancement.
