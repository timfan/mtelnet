		Long time ago, men used to be the center of sports, with the myth that doing sports was their ways to actualize and practice masculinity. Thus lots of sportswear and tools for men were developed. However, with the rise in the number of women who loves sports, there comes a lot more styles and models on women sportswear. It makes a splash to the area of sport-tech as well. <br/>
<br/>
That’s how the idea of the smart bra has come up. OMbra, designed by OMSignal, holds the idea that as women are wearing the sport bras anyway, why can’t they choose to wear the ‘smart ones’ instead? Then a bra down to a science, is born with key design elements: stretchable fabric with mesh to ensure breathability, adjustable straps and closure to limit the breast movement while exercising, and removable padding to adjust to different shapes and sizes.<br/>
<br/>
There is a sensor called the Smart Box, which is inserted in the lower band of the bra and settles along the rib cage. The data module records and streams real-time biometric data wirelessly from the bra to the smartphone app, OMRun platform.<br/>

As data will be collected in one central hub, the app would show users the overall health and how they are doing throughout their workout, such as keeping track of their heart rate, breathing rhythm, calories burned and steps. This helps users to moderate their respiratory system and enable them to use less energy when running. Moreover, the OM Smart Box can also be connected with multiple apps, such as Apple Health, Strava, Nike+, MapMyFitness and Runtastic. Not only is the bra equipped with advanced technology, it also comes in vibrant colors. And just like a normal sport bra, it can be thrown to wash once the OM Smart Box is popped off. <br/>

“We did a lot of research into the psychology of wearables and found that men and women are of course very different. Again to generalize, but women have a better understanding of how the body ticks. And with sports, they value feedback that will help better themselves, whereas men tend to be looking more for comparisons with others. We took that insight, and the fact that women have been driving the wearables field even though there has been no product in the category that was truly designed with a female perspective, and that’s what we tried to do. It was a very deliberate approach to serving a women’s product.” OM co-founder, Stephane Marceau told Forbes in an interview.<br/>

<br/>
OMbra is truly an innovative invention. It does not just benefit numerous women who play sports; but it also subverts the tradition of sports and technology, the domains normally driven by men. <br/>
