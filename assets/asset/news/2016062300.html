		When microchips implantation technology is getting mature and cheaper, now people can build one on their bodies out of their wills. You didn’t hear it wrong; it’s putting a microchip in the human body. Just think about it like building a microchip into your pets’ skin. Why couldn’t it be applied on the human body?<br/>
<br/>
		Recently, two persons from different parts of the world have implanted a microchip in their hands. Biohacking experiment is a new wave people blending their bodies with technology. <br/>
<br/>
		Charlie Warzel, the first bio-hacker from New York managed to live for a month making all his payments just by phone. Then he gave himself a new challenge - implanting a RFID (Radio frequent Identifier) in the back of his hand - the same one used to keep track of pets.<br/>
<br/>
		In order to get the implantation done, he actually went to Sweden. The chip itself didn’t work alone, so he paired up his chip with Venmo, a payment and money sharing app. His move to transfer his Venmo user ID onto the chip enables any phone to recognize the chip as the actual Venmo app. <br/>

		While Charlie mainly focuses on mobile payment, another man named Meow-Ludo Meow Meow, from Sydney Australia has more ideas on unlocking the potential of a microchip in human body.  He sees microchip implantation as a new way to interact with the technology.<br/>
<br/>
		Besides mobile payment, Meow has a bigger plan with the NFC chip to make daily life mundane chores easier. It mainly serves in two areas: authentication and activation. For authentication, it plays different roles for various purposes, including the business cards, medical documents, location records, transportation cards and credit cards. Meow believes that if the future chip is smarter, it could be auto-connected to health sensors or other devices like Fitbit. <br/>
<br/>
		For activation, it will be like people can simply put their hands on the steering wheel to start their cars. It will also bring us a seamless grocery shopping experience, like every piece of products touched will be added in the shopping cart and the transaction will happen automatically.<br/>

		Having a chip in our bodies definitely opens up a whole new world full of possibilities. A whole bunch of interesting questions raised one after another: What if my cat already had a microchip, could I just get it reprogrammed so it can be my wallet? Will everyone get a chip injection when they are born? What kinds of information will be put in the chip? If we all have a chip in our hands, can we exchange information in a second when shaking hands? Would terrible crimes happen, like people get robbed and have their hands chopped off? Or what if criminals create alibi by using fake identities? <br/>
<br/>
		The idea of implanting a chip in the human body predicted by the science fiction finally came true. Are you interested in putting one in your body? <br/>
