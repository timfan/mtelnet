<br/>
<br/>While Internet of Things (IoT) is getting popular, some studies predict that 26 billions of IoT will be installed by 2020 and almost everything will be connected. This enables IoT to resolve city problems on a larger scale!
<br/>
<br/>The concept of ‘smart cities’ can be traced back to few years ago. It refers to how the functions of a city can be optimized to promote the development of a talent-based economy and to improve the quality of life by the information and communication technologies (ICT).
<br/>
<br/>Several factors make IoT highly accessible. The first is the lower price point of sensors, processors and networking. Second, Internet connectivity has been greatly enhanced year by year. The cost of data storage and computation is reducing along with the advancement of technology as well.
<br/>
<br/><b>What can IoT do? </b>
<br/>IoT has penetrated into every level of our life. It can be divided into four tiers: smart self, smart living, smart industry and smart city.

<br/>
<br/>IoT works in a combo of data, sensor and analytics. IoT devices only collect data. Once it is connected with the sensor, data is turned into analytics for better decision-making. Smart self means wearables like the fitness tracker which monitors health condition and exercising efficiency. Next are all the automations in the smart home system making our lives easier. 
<br/>
<br/>Different industries utilize IoT in various ways. For example, a smart air-conditioner could collect temperature data which facilitates the analysis of the user behavior so retails can serve customers easier.  Applied in agriculture as well, IoT helps growers get timely reports of the crops for the optimal growing conditions and timing.    
<br/>
<br/>Another IoT being commonly used is the barcode. Nowadays products are transformed into ID that almost every product gets a QR code. It helps the supply chain in two dimensions: traceability and customer behavior analysis. For traceability, it’s mainly used for product safety and authenticity like food and medical devices imported from foreign countries. Users can check the manufacturing information by scanning the code on smartphone. 
<br/>
<br/>And the RFID technology is used for customer behavior analysis. A jewelry chain tags a mini RFID on every piece of jewelry. When a customer picks and tries the jewelries, the sensor will record the combination at the same time. Matching with the demographic, the analytics bring strong customer insights to refine marketing strategies.
<br/>                                                                                                                                                                
<br/><b>IoT’s role in smart cities </b>
<br/>At a city level, IoT alone cannot help a city to become digitally transformed. But it can gather data from multiple sources. As everyone brings their own devices, mobile offers an efficient way for citizens to report matters in the city. For instance, IoT helps in city road optimization. When problems happen on the roads, it is inconvenient for drivers to report them to the government. Then an app called ‘<a href="http://www.streetbump.org/" target="_blank"><u>Street Bump</u></a>’ has been developed by the city of Boston. When a car bumps, the app will automatically sense it. The officials will get notified from the analysis that the black spots are where with the most bumps.

<br/>
<br/>There are a lot more areas that IoTs could work for a better city, such as public safety (crowd management, emergency notification), smart city (water management, trash and garbage collection, lighting control, infrastructure monitoring and building automation systems), and connected healthcare (patient monitoring, integrated healthcare with at-home care). Certainly, IoT is a big part worth further developed which everyone looks forward to new IoT innovations.
