How do they collect your likes and unlikes? It seems that marketers are seizing every single opportunity to reach their targeted customers. Credit to personalization.

		<b>Why personalization? </b><br/>
Personalization becomes important since customers’ attitudes are ever-changing. In fact, they have changed significantly over the past few years. In an era of information explosion, people are overwhelmed by messages so they have paid shorter attention spent onto information. As a result, they tend to block marketing inputs by turning off push notifications, unsubscribing from emails, blocking cookies and advertisements. However, consumers are increasingly expecting and engaging with personalized messages and experiences. To cope with this, personalization has been proven effective in increasing clicks and conversions by adding personalization features. It’s a much more broad way working for marketers.<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, small companies could build intimate relationships with customers easily by direct contacts. However, when the organizations grow in scale, the challenge comes. The permutation is way too large -- how can they keep good understanding with their customers? <br/>
<br/>
Then personalization walks in. Personalization means using technology to tailor-make messages and experiences to the individuals and interact with them. The process of personalization is about knowing whom you are talking to and engaging them with relevant contents. Today, marketing is not about the message or a campaign as it used to be. Instead, it’s very customer-centric. A spectrum of capability of personalization can be implemented.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How to get started?</b><br/>
The process of personalization can be broken down into a few primers of parts. First of all, identity. Understanding your audience is always the first thing to do --- knowing who they are, what they care about, what channels they are using and so on. Identity-related data such as demographic, location, family detail, postal address, population density as well as additional information like browsing behavior, transactional history and product catalog usage are worth collecting too. For instance, you need to know how close a customer is to your store or a competitor’s store. Though it is getting harder and much more complex, it is much more effective as understanding your audience means better targeting at them. Except customers’ past buying behavior, capturing real-time activity and unstructured data provides increased contextual and relevant understanding of what action someone is taking in real time, upon which relevant marketing contents can be stirred up in real time.<br/>
<br/>
The second stage is to convey contents relevant to target audience. Customer is a living social role. There is a big grey area of what they like and unlike. If we are able to find out their preferences, serving them more with what they like, they will feel more relevant to the services and goods you are selling. There are lots of tricks to collect these preferences. For example, customers can enter their preferences when they sign up for memberships so relevant contents will be shown to them more often. Time-out strategy is one of the tactics too. We look into the frequency of purchased things. To give an example, after customer A bought a certain item, the same kind of deal would not be shown to him for a while. <br/>
<br/>
The final stage is to deliver the content to the target audience across channels. We mainly focus on four channels: advertisement, web, mobile and email. For advertisements, replace current models with retargeting strategy. Retargeting marks online users who visit a certain brand website with a pixel or a cookie, and then serves banner ads only to the people who have shown at least certain amount of engagement with the original brand. Retargeting usually runs on lower cost media but increases effectiveness by specifically targeting an interested audience. By using data management platform, you will assemble the first party data rather than the third party data gained through data aggregators, which would also be accessed by competitors. Like a funnel filtering across the market, retargeting helps narrow the top 20% audiences and understand customers better even for advertising. <br/>
<br/>
From the result of interviews with over 500 marketers, email is found to be the leading channel where personalization can be made. How you write the email is important. The subject line determines your audiences' response --- to open the email or not. The key is to make them feel relevant to the topic. Besides, through reaching out to customers like engaging customers in product designs, pricing models and valuing products, behavioral data can be collected. Applying these predictive analytics allows resellers and brands to make unique offer by individual. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Is it different when personalization comes to food?</b><br/>
Personalization can be applicable on food too as everyone needs food. When people think of what to eat, they already have a set of preferences in mind. The point is, how to make customers think of us when they place their orders? It all starts from re-engineering with your backend marketing and personalizing behind the scene--- looking into people’s food preferences and individual ordering patterns, getting relevant to diners and starting from personalized email and transferring to all marketing strategies gradually. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Tracking long-term success</b><br/>
Many companies did not capture the long-term impact of personalization. The impact is long-term rather than short-term. Apart from improving user experience, working better and better for what you have been doing, you can also customize personalization models in order to meet the need of business. Challenge yourself to think beyond historical data and the current models, as the data no longer comes only from the third party. If you have new models, your business evolves; your customers should have changed accordingly and long-term brand success is not far from you.<br/>
