Now, you can check the busiest hours of a restaurant by searching its name or the address on Google Search on Chrome or Google Now on Android phone. A location card will come on top to show relevant business details. Clicking on ‘More’, Popular Times, a new feature will allow you to see the foot traffic graph likely to be during a week. It indicates the foot traffic hourly in bar chart. No actual number is provided, as apparently it is not using the common method of installing a traffic counter on top of the shop entrance. Data collected is based on the historical visits. <br/>
<br/>
The statistic is approximate as Google locates foot traffic by its records from Google Now and Google location services users, which Google can track their past movements. You may wonder how accurate the graph is, as the sample data were collected from a limited number of users: people who did not use Google service also passed by. This affects the accuracy of the foot traffic.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is another example showing how O2O has integrated into our life seamlessly. Traditionally, foot traffic used to be important to business only in the past as it is directly related to sales amount. Higher foot traffic can lead to higher sales. With the foot traffic data, the business can analyze and modify their marketing strategies to increase sales.  <br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, now, similar data are open to the public. People want to have a handful grasp of information through the local search engine to make the best planning of their time. Customer journey starts before customers’ head for the stores. People can search online first. Along with the store address, opening hours and contact number, customers’ reviews and photos inside the store are also shown to viewers so people can preview the store environment and have more information when choosing where to dine or shop.<br/>
<br/>
Though the Google foot traffic counter does not indicate the actual numbers, and cannot give a precise result, it opens up our eyes to a brand new concept on foot traffic counter instead of installing a costly traffic counter at a physical store. The cost includes the hardware cost, installation cost, license fee and software set-up fee. Now there is another way to collect data. And it is a project aiming to provide service to global users. Data are collected from android users. Would you feel more willing to be tracked, while Google gathers your information for your good in return?   <br/>
<br/>
Showing popular days and a break-down of times that generate the most foot traffic brings advantages as well as the downside. For those stores on a budget for retail analytics tools to track the number of people strolling in and out of their locations, Google provides free reference statistics for owners to compare with actual situations to make better business decisions accordingly.     <br/>
<br/>
However, probably not every store wants this free busiest time indicator, especially the hottest stores busy around the clock in town. The indicator only drives customers away to competitors when they see the graph showing the shop is too busy.<br/>
<br/>
After testing on addresses in Hong Kong, the service currently has not come to Hong Kong yet. It seems hard to be applicable to Hong Kong too. Hong Kong is crowded, which results in high-rise development. Different types of business are inside one building, which the Google foot traffic counter can only track people passing by the building. However, this works in another way, for HongKongers are used to making use of every space to put advertisements on, including the walls of buildings. It provides some reference statistics to building owners to bargain with companies which want to put mega-posters or TVs on their buildings on the rental. <br/>
<br/>
From a customer’s point of view, the feature appears to be not too useful.  Would it probably be more useful if the number of people standing in line or photos of queue would be updated every hour, or the information such as expected waiting time, published by the business could be listed on the location card?<br/>
