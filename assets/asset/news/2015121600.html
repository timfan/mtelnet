		Citi Mobile Challenge is a virtual accelerator with a robust curriculum and mentorship program held by Citi Bank, which aims to inspire developers to reimagine mobile banking. Finalists will have the opportunity to showcase their ideas and stimulate digital progress in the industry.<br/>
		<br/>
		First held in Latin America in 2014, the Citi Mobile Challenge has traveled to the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.<br/>
		<br/>
		This year, Mtel participated in the Citi Mobile Challenge Asia Pacific with our solution SmartLoan, a one-stop loan and installment management app for customers to master their finances. <br/>
		<br/>
		Since September 2015, we have gone through 3 phases of assessments, and were one of the 72 finalists selected from 1,900 teams from 376 countries. <br/>
		<br/>
		A month after the Hong Kong demo day on 12th November, we were thriving to be awarded the Best Money Manager Solution! We were honored to be one of the only two top innovators from Hong Kong. Citi offers us cash awards plus the opportunity to explore a commercial relationship with it and other leading FinTech companies and sponsors.<br/>
		<br/>
		Stay tuned for our further collaboration with Citibank!<br/>
