		When you hear the term ‘Smart watch’, what do you think of? A Fitbit fitness tracker or an Apple watch? The latest smart watch has now come in Braille for visually impaired people.

While modern technology is evolving day and night, we live in a world of information and technology. Simultaneously, visually impaired people feel more isolated and cut off. According to studies, only 1% of normal books are translated to Braille books. Don’t mention how the blinds can perceive things happening around them; smartphone is always not for them since they cannot experience the vivid colors or animations on the screen, nor knowing where to tap a button to proceed to the next step. Even when they use smartphones, they mainly rely on phones reading words out. This causes another issue – the blinds barely have privacy. Their personal messages, the places they are heading to and even bank account balance are all read out. 
<br/>
<br/>To break down the barrier, DOT, a Braille smart watch developed by a South Korean venture company by four university students, will be released in the latter half of this year. Students were inspired seeing their friends with poor sight having difficulties in pursuing learning. Traditionally, blind people can only rely learning on Braille textbooks and Braille-supporting electronic devices. Refreshable Braille displays do allow people with complete blindness or poor sight to use the computer system. However, most of the visually impaired people cannot use as much as they wish to because these devices are too expensive and bulky to carry around. The founders hope their innovation can help disabled people at home as well as abroad. Therefore, they test the prototype with the visually handicapped and listen to their feedback to improve the product.

<br/>The size of dots on the terminal of DOT is just one twenty of typical terminals. The terminal size is dramatically reduced through a new type of actuator that represents the braille cells. While traditional actuators are on ceramic substrate, they experiment the watch with magnetic fields so it can generate various physical activities. Through singular magnetic field, it can prevent clashes among pins. 
<br/>
<br/>The module contains five groups of six active dots each, which are enough for five Braille characters to be displayed at once. Connecting to a mobile device, it can receive notifications, rely navigation and allow blind people to access various text data such as messages, tweets and books anywhere, anytime.

<br/>“Until now, if you got a message on iOS from your girlfriend, for example, you had to listen to Siri read it to you in that voice, which is impersonal,” DOT CEO Eric Ju Yoon Kim told <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/dot-braille-smartwatch/" target="_blank"><u>Tech in Asia</u></a>. “Wouldn’t you rather read it yourself and hear your girlfriend’s voice saying it in your head?”
<br/>
<br/>The price of digital Braille readers is always expensive, which causes 95% of blind people to give up learning Braille. The device will be sold at an affordable price at USD$300 which sharply reduces the cost. 
<br/>
<br/>As stated in its Youtube video, DOT’s primary mission remains information accessibility for the blind, bringing them closer to the digital world. Apart from the usability, DOT’s design is sophisticated and sleek.  Unlike other IT devices for handicapped people, DOT is a device that users would be proud to wear. ‘If the ever-evolving smart technology can take into consideration of the disabled people as well as the broader public, the development could be meaningful’, said the team. ‘We strive to reduce the invisible discrimination against people living with blindness in information accessibility’.

<br/>
<br/>Although e-books can be read through DOT, this is not the most convenient option. To address this, DOT is planning to develop a tablet version, the dot pad to display multi-line texts, graphs, and shapes to cater the need of education, but complex texts and diagrams, like mathematics, are still off-limits to the blind. 
<br/>
<br/>Though DOT will be shelved in the US and Canada first, the biggest challenge for the team is the limited market. As the device is for blind people, one cannot expand the market through attracting people to use the device. So their picture is to ‘going global’, such as expanding market shares in countries like Japan and China. While Japan has a strong policy of building infrastructures to respond to the needs of disabled citizens, China accounts for nearly one-fifth of the world’s blind population. Kim sees huge growing potential in both markets.
<br/>
<br/>This is the biggest step the wearable device could ever take. It shows technology is for all and technology also covers the need of the minority group in the society.
