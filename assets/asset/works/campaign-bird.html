									Common on-premise email marketing software has its limitation on infrastructure, such as limited delivery throughput due to MTA and ISP connectivity limitations and lack of complaint feedback loops. Bottlenecked at web server, recipients may take more time to download email content, especially when great number of recipients are opening emails at the same time. It also lacks system redundancy and backup.<br/>
									<br/>
									General Email Direct Marketing (EDM) relies on manual layout and input, which marketers need to spend a long time designing the email every time. This greatly hinders the nature of EDM-- sending the news out when it is still warm. Marketers also cannot measure the impact of their email marketing campaigns, like the click-to-open rate, the percentage of bounce email and so on. Lacking of complaint feedback loop, they are not sure if their emails get delivered. The lack of precise statistics also makes it hard to improve and take the best out of EDM.<br/>

									Using Amazon Web Service Cloud, Campaign Bird is located at Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This enables Mtel to create a Hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between our datacenter and VPC, which leverages the AWS cloud as an extension of our own datacenter. <br/>
									<br/>
									Running with Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), which is a highly scalable and cost-effective bulk and transactional email-sending service leveraging Amazon’s sophisticated email infrastructure, Campaign Bird maximizes email deliverability and maintains complaint feedback loops from major ISPs. Amazon SES eliminates the complexity and operating a third-party email service for this type of email communication.<br/>
									<br/>
									Campaign Bird delivers email content via Amazon CloudFront. It is a global content delivery network (CDN) distributing content to the end users automatically routed to the nearest edge location, so content is delivered with the best possible performance at high data transfer speed with low latency.<br/>
									<br/>
									Powered by AWS Cloud’s various features mentioned above, Campaign Bird helps users exert full control on sending and tracking email campaigns anywhere, any time. It includes smart bounce handling, automatical hard bounced address removal from the mailing list and complaints from major ISPs. Users can set the schedule, batch and throttling options and decide when to send emails. This guarantees successful delivery of emails.   <br/>
									<br/>
									Marketers no longer need to spend long hours handling with email designs. The Newsletter Designer feature provides users with pre-designed email templates to choose. Users can now add personalized newsletters and dynamic contents to their newsletter by inserting merge tags to the content. They can also import newsletter designs from their computers by uploading an archive file to create brand identity as well.<br/>
									<br/>
									Image Gallery lets users organize their images with campaign or newsletter design, and manage them online. All the images will be delivered via Amazon’s CDN (Content Delivery Network), and CloudFront for faster loading of your contents. Once the newsletter is ready, users can send free tests to their own inbox. <br/>
									<br/>
									Users can view a dashboard visualizing real-time data into figures of Open, Click, Conversion, Bounce, Complaint, and Unsubscribe rate. More than that, location of subscribers, devices and mails that clients use are all shown. While users can see the trend from time to time by analyzing addressees’ behaviors, marketers can also understand their target audiences better, thus refining their advertising to meet market expectations. <br/>
									<br/>
									Apart from this, Campaign Bird provides users with personalized forms and pages to help them customize their subscription forms, confirmation emails, goodbye emails, acknowledgements and confirmation pages with their own brand identity by just turning to Campaign Bird’s easy-to-use forms and pages designer. This offers people a way to subscribe to the enterprise’s newsletter, to stay tuned with the news and to get exposed to the company’s products. <br/>
									<br/>
									The list management feature enables users to manage lists and subscriptions. People can subscribe to them on the website, by scanning a QR code, by email or by text. It allows users to import and export their subscriptions.<br/>
									<br/>
									REST API is also applied in campaign management, list management, and transactional email. Auto fixes and CSS conversions are also used for best mail client compatibility. Campaign Bird can convert emails into text messages and send them from the computer. Partnering with Amazon Web Service, Campaign Bird has been providing scalable, reliable service to enterprises at an affordable price. <br/>

									Enterprises are in need of an easy-to-use tool for effective EDM. Therefore we developed Campaign Bird, a one-stop all-round enterprise EDM platform. We strive to make Campaign Bird different from other platforms in the market fundamentally-- for better privacy, better control, and better performance at lower cost. <br/>
									To reach outstanding performance and reliability, Campaign Bird is natively built and ran on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It utilizes several services from AWS, including Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for highly scalable and reliable computing, Simple Queue Service (SQS) for high performance system communication, Simple Email Service (SES) for high email deliverability, CloudFront for global high speed content delivery, and Simple Storage Service (S3) for reliable data backup.<br/>
