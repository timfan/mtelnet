									Today’s retail environment is evolving at an exponential pace as technology is transforming customers’ shopping patterns. The digitally savvy consumers are expecting more exciting interactions with physical products in-store, as well as some kind of extended customer experience beyond the store, online. Omni-channel is a fully integrated and seamless experience to connect retailers with customers better. It is a management system integrating channels on the back end, which gives retailers complete transparency to own their data for marketing strategies.<br/>
									<br/>
									Our client, whose core businesses is engaged in trading, logistics, distribution and retailing, conceived that China is a new ideal market for adopting Omni-channel. There is a growing number of Chinese consumers interacting with brands through social media.  Our client has turned the Omni-channel concept into reality by operating an a large-scale laboratory in Shanghai called Explorium, which allows brands to experiment with new business models and techniques that will shape the future of the retail industry. We aim to help our client understand visitors’ mobile activities in and around their shopping mall. These insights can power relevant engagement strategies by optimizing the shopping experience and increasing in-app conversions.<br/>

									The shopping mall Explorium is family-based, designed with a whole new concept in the region, of which all shops and brands are child-oriented. It aims at attracting customers coming to the mall along with their family members on weekends and during their free time. It offers an edutainment experience to customers -- while kids are learning in playgroups, parents can do shopping at other parts of the mall. This embarks on a more interactive shopping experience than ever before. In order to keep customers visiting the mall frequently, the theme of the mall, pop-up stores and workshops will be replaced once in a while. However, what is the best way to relocate stores in place to maximize the profit?

									We believe gaining insight into in-store shopper behaviors can optimize store operations and help deliver an exceptional customer experience. Realizing parents customers’ desires to monitor their kids closely in this large shopping mall, we meet their needs by providing a customer app that can track the location of their kids. To apply iBeacon technology, kids need to wear the iBeacon device registered with their parents’ mobiles while they first enter the mall. The iBeacon device also serves as a hangtag to check in with the scanners to earn points. As points are earned via both activity-based and duration-based modes, they provide valuable contextual data ranging from in-store traffic patterns and volumes, individual paths and dwell times, to mass shopping journeys and patterns influencing business operations.<br/>
									<br/>
									Besides providing help to customers along with their stays in the mall, our customer app also serves as a channel building a closer relationship and facilitating interactions between customers and our client. Learning about visitor actions in real time through rapid access to contextual data, businesses can utilize such a valuable resource in adapting and modifying their strategies to accommodate consumer needs. With these insights, retailers can tailor dynamic messages specifically for each app users. Apart from warm welcome messages, specific promotions and relevant marketing interactions can be sent to visitors according to their age, preferences and duration in the mall in real time. Personalized marketing ensures a consistent experience across every single point of interaction. <br/>
									<br/>
									To engage customers in every stage, the customer app can provide customers with useful information before their trips to the mall, including the map, the schedule of workshops and activities, news and promotions. We aim to bring them a brand new shopping experience in Omni-channel. Shopping is no longer only done physically;  customers can now also process their orders simutenously on phone. Users can simply add products to their shopping carts by scanning QR codes on the product hangtags. And there are two ways to pay. Cuatomers can pay at the central cashiers. A QR code will be gernerated on the phone so the cashier can quickly access the bill. Another way is to pay online. Users can choose in-store pickup or home delivery. This extends the shopping journey from offline to online and the other way round.<br/>
									<br/> 
									By filling intelligent location awareness as part of their mobile engagement platform, our solutions expedite the value of marketing transformation toward Omni-channel commerce. Allowing brands and retailers to obtain unique insights for individual businesses, our solution minimizes their costs and risks. After three-month operation, valuable insight is uncovered. Analysis has shown that over 40 percent of customers come from the upper-middle and affluent income segments of Shanghai. While this group tends to spend less dwell time than other demographic groups of participants, the 10 percent higher conversion rate of this group has proven that they have a higher propensity to purchase. Notably, the value of marketing transformation has been expedited by obtaining real-time information from the shopping mall as part of a broader Omni-channel programme.<br/>

									Obviously, different types of shopping patterns emerge with respect to various kinds of visitor combinations. For example, the shopping journey of a family with kids and a family without kids is different. Customers’ age, gender, preferences, shopping sequences, etc are crucial for the layout arrangement and marketing strategies. How beneficial will it be if our client grasps the demographic data of their customers?
