									ManulifeMOVE is a brand new concept to cater for the need of increasingly digital-savvy customers. In the past, clients seldom contacted their agents until there was a claim needed to be processed. This always casts insurance a negative image. In order to enhance clients’ trust and loyalty towards Manulife, ManulifeMOVE aims to relate insurance to everyday life—a programme which encourages clients to challenge themselves every day by making fitness a lifestyle and proving that it pays to look after themselves. Wearing the fitness tracker, users can track their daily moves including steps, sleeping cycles, calories being burned, etc.  <br/>
									However, Manulife is serving a great numbers of clients and all clients joining the programme need to check their progress daily to see if they have met their goals. In this mobile-everywhere age, logging on to the website to check such data is too slow and not user-friendly.<br/>

								<div class="content">	
									Being the newest fitness tracker app on the market, ManulifeMOVE comes to members with a personal approach. Members of MOVE programme have individual account to login. After linking the app to one’s fitness tracker account, the average daily number of steps is calculated by totalling the number of steps, recorded by the fitness tracker, and dividing it by the number of days since the users activated ManulifeMOVE. Such an easy access motivates clients to check with their number of steps daily as checking is fast in one tap on the phone. The data collected by the fitness tracker is shown in easy-to-read charts and graphs. Members can closely monitor their progress daily.<br/>
									The app also provides tips on how to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle. It   continuously engages with customers through regular advices and tips on staying healthy, thus providing them with a more holistic solution. <br/>
									There are also promotions and offers of Manulife put in-app from time to time which the app serves as a channel to reach clients, thus increasing their exposure to Manalife products.<br/>
									For members who are using existing fitness trackers, they can also activate the ManulifeMOVE mobile app provided that the trackers are of the same brand or model as those currently supported by ManulifeMOVE as well.<br/>
									<br/>
									Mtel is pleased to be part of the comprehensive programme, as it helps attract new clients to “make their move” to choose the insurances services at Manulife and old clients to sign new insurance contracts for the discounts offered by the programme. It is a win-win solution by the saying ‘Make your every move more rewarding’, as clients are rewarded in the short term by paying less in the next membership year and become more healthy on the long run by avioding the onset of Chronic diseases. On the part of Manulife, with the programme, less clients need to claim expenses from Manulife in the future. <br/>
