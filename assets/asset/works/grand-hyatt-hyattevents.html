								<div class="content">
									As a great deal of conferences and meetings are taking place in the hotel throughout the year, wide arrays of attendees, exhibitors and speakers gather from all over the world. Conference details always change up to a minute. When attendees come back and forth between venues on the conference day, it is hard for the organizers to give them the updated information they need. It is also a challenge to gather all the feedbacks in the conference with a hall full of attendees. Apart from these, Grand Hyatt also want to attract customers to revisit to their hotel.

								<div class="content">	
									Mtel has managed to combine all the key aspects of a meeting, seminar or conference into one easy-to-navigate mobile application that is available in English, Traditional and Simplified Chinese. It provides everything attendees need: personalized agenda, maps, networking and much more. <br/>
									<br/>
									Once organizers and attendees login to specific events they are attending, their daily agendas are shown. For each session, attendees can find the profile of the organizer, speakers or exhibitors, study FAQs and make reservation. Detailed venue floor plans, facilities and restaurants information within the venue are included as well so attendees can plan their schedules before-hand. In case changes happen, push notifications containing latest information can be sent to attendees. Powered by Amazon Web Service, the Content Management System (CMS) of the app is running upon the Amazon Simple Email Service (SES). Amazon SES ensures the emails arrive at their intended destinations, so the contents are arriving timely and accurately. <br/>
									<br/>
									During the meeting, organizers can manage live polling, Q&A and surveys in each of the session and receive real-time results in graph format, which helps engage attendees in the meeting. Conversations can be sparked after the event through the media center as well. Users can view event photos, video content and uploaded documents. They can interact via private inbox messaging, which helps create networking. <br/>
									<br/>
									Hosted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), HyattEvents is supported fully in availability, scalability and cost effectiveness. As thousands of attendees might access the app simultaneously during a conference and when live polling is taking place, EC2 allows HyattEvents to scale its server number up or down within minutes according to the number of users. This guarantees the stability of the app. Multiple data centers of EC2 have strengthened the reliability of HyattEvents. Due to the unexpected ups and downs in number of users, the on-demand instances recorded allow our client to pay for the compute capacity they actually consume.<br/>
									<br/>
									The digital calendar is an exclusive communication channel for guests and clients of Grand Hyatt Macau. Users can keep their busy life well organized. At the same time, the calendar presents the latest information, special events and exclusive offers of the hotel to customers.  Users can be kept updated about the hottest happenings in Macau through the calendar as well. The calendar is ideal for global travellers, as the international weather feature showcases weather conditions and temperature forecasts in 60 cities.<br/>
									The Events App and Digital Calendar are delivering new levels of digital information, seamless service and convenience for guests and event organizers.<br/>
